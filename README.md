# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_COMPANY_FINANCIALS_DATA

I did this project in collaboration with UNP. The Company Financials Dashboard offers an in-depth assessment of the organizationâ€™s financial health, focusing on revenue, profit, and cost efficiency. It monitors overall sales, both gross and net profit, and essential financial metrics across multiple segments. By analyzing revenue patterns over time, the dashboard identifies high-performing products and examines the effect of discounts on sales. It also provides a detailed cost analysis, pinpointing areas for potential savings. Key insights include annual growth trends, profit margins, and financial stability indicators. This data-driven framework enables strategic decision-making, enhances profitability, and optimizes financial planning.
